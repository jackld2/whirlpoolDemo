# Background
This application was made for an interview with Whirlpool Corporation. It is a simple demo for a user to understand a clothes dryer by being able to disassemble and analyze each internal and external part. The dryer internals and externals were modeled by hand in blender. The demo was built in unity with the Oculus Rift Toolkit.
