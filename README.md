# Background
This experience was made for as an interview project for Whirlpool Corporation (made in one day). It is a simple proof of concept for a user to understand a clothes dryer's components and functions by being able to disassemble and analyze each internal and external part. The dryer internals and externals were modeled by hand in blender. The demo was built in unity with the Oculus Rift Toolkit.
